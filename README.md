# HandWritten_Digit_Recognization_Using_Python
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to develop a machine learning system that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits. The project leverages Python and popular machine learning libraries to build a model capable of identifying the correct digit from input images.

For developing this we use pygame for Digit Board. And used python libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras etc .

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Choose an IDE to write and execute your Python code. Popular choices include:

  ** - Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive coding environment that allows you to write and run code in a notebook-like interface.
  ** - Visual Studio Code: ** A lightweight and extensible code editor with excellent Python support through extensions.

 **Required Python Libraries: ** Install the necessary Python libraries to work on the handwritten digit recognition project. The essential libraries include:
 
  ** - Pygame** is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python.
  ** - NumPy** ,which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
  ** - Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible. Create publication quality plots.To visualize our data using matplotlib library, firstly we have to import matplotlib, and then we are able to see the first image of our training data using imshow().
  ** - Keras** is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models. It is part of the TensorFlow library and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

**Additional Libraries: ** Depending on the specific techniques and models you choose to implement, you may require additional libraries. For example:

   **- TensorFlow:** Deep learning libraries that offer more advanced models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.TensorFlow allows you to create dataflow graphs that describe how data moves through a graph. The graph consists of nodes that represent a mathematical operation. A connection or edge between nodes is a multidimensional data array.
   **- OpenCV:** A computer vision library that can assist with preprocessing tasks like image resizing, noise reduction, or edge detection.
